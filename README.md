# LaunchPAD: Priority on African Diagnostics

LaunchPAD is the first phase of the Climate Model Evaluation Hub for Africa. The aim of this project is to create diagnostics that can be used in model evaluations for Africa. 10 early career researchers and LaunchPAD fellows created the diagnostics shared in this repository. 

To learn more about LaunchPAD, the fellows, and their diagnositcs take a look at our project website: https://launchpad6.home.blog 

Each of the diagnostics have an folder within DIAGNOSTICS. Here you will also find a README for each diagnostic that details the rational for the diagnostic, a step by step method, and some sample plots. These also contain the contact information of the fellow responsible for each diagnostic and their contact information. Not all of these diagnostic methods have been published and permission to cite requires permission from the authors of the diagnostic.
