LaunchPAD - Acknowledgements

The goal of this project was to create a Climate Model Evaluation Hub for Africa. 

Collaboration between four universities in Africa (KNUST, University of Nairobi, University of Yaoundé, University of Cape Town) and the team at University of Oxford was responsible for creating diagnostics that can be used to evaluate important processes within the African climate system. These diagnostics were converted into a standardised framework in Python and evaluated with CMIP5/CMIP6 models from the CEDA achieve and third-party observations. This was released as a list of stand-alone diagnostics on GitHub:

Collaboration between the UK Met Office and the team at University of Oxford was responsible for taking the framework of climate model Africa specific diagnostics and implementing them into Auto-Assess. This document forms the main documentation for that software package.

The people responsible for the pre-framework diagnostics implemented in this package are as follows:
Thompson Annor – KNUST – West African Heat Low, West African Heat Band and West African Precipitation Band. 
Apphia Ackon – KNUST – Sea Surface Temperature Bias. 
Anthony Mwanthi – University of Nairobi – Atmospheric Coupling Index and Terrestrial Coupling Index
Oscar Lino – University of Nairobi – Turkana Jet
Makinde Akintunde – University of Cape Town – West African Westerly Jet
Rondrotiana Barimalala – University of Cape Town – Mozambique Channel Trough
Paige Donkin – University of Cape Town – Storm Tracking Metrics
Ellen Dyer – Oxford University - Central African Flow
Thierry Taguela – University of Yaoundé - Low Level Westerlies
Giresse Turin – University of Yaoundé – African Easterly Jet

Tom Webb, University of Oxford is responsible for the creation of the Python framework for diagnostic development.

The people responsible for converting the diagnostics into the Python framework are:
Ellen Dyer, University of Oxford
Tom Webb, University of Oxford

Tom Webb, University of Oxford is responsible for creating the Auto-Assess launchpad framework, Auto-Assess code enhancements, converting the diagnostics into the Auto-Assess launchpad framework and testing the LaunchPAD system in Auto-Assess on JASMIN.

Paul Earnshaw, UK Met Office is responsible for testing the LaunchPAD system in Auto-Assess on the Met Office system.

The Principle Investigators on this project were:
Rachel James, University of Oxford.
Prof. Richard Washington, University of Oxford.
Cath Senior, UK Met Office.
Thompson Annor, KNUST.
Wilfried Pokam, University of Yaounde.
Joseph Mutemi, University of Nairobi.
